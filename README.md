# Personal Portfolio

## Description

In order to showcase my work to potential employers, I need a website. This website has a picture of me, a brief introduction of myself, projects of mine, and my contact information. All of this information is in one spot allowing visitors to learn a lot about me in a short amount of time. Through building this website I learned a lot about the importance of strong wireframing, as a solid and smart structure will allow a lot of the heavy lifting to be done during the HTML phase.
